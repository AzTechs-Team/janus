    <br>"Janus" was derived from Roman Mythology. According to Roman Mythology, Janus is the god of beginnings and endings. Janus is an application which would signify the start and end of a work day, and help the user navigate through it all.
    <br><br> Janus is an cross-platform desktop application to solve all workflow issues and increase productivity. Here user can customize according to their workflow. They can also add plugins to set up different tasks.
    They can include everything from getting notifications from different applications in one place, getting updates from services using web-hooks, scheduling the opening of various applications based on their calendar for the day. 
    <br><br>Janus helps different professions and for students adding improved workflows. The workflows will provide a bootstrap template for the user to then customize and fit with their own schedule. This allows the user to be in control of the application, so it is not bloated with extra overhead.
    The scope of this application is quite vast due to increased remote work over the past 2 years. Anyone who uses a computer/laptop on a daily basis can be benefited by this application. The main idea is to de-clutter the workspace and combine all the functionalities in one space.
    <br><br>Janus is a minimal, customizable, cross-platform application that can help achieve this.
    There would essentially be several different extensions/pluginavailable in the marketplace, which the user can install if needed. Each of these plugins would help with a different task, and unclutter the rest of the workspace.
    Janus has bootstrap workflows, to simplify the setup. This means, there would be several different pre-built extensions which would be grouped and installed together. 
    Janus decreases the mess created by handling multiple productivity applications, and create a one-stop solution for it. This will have just the authentication along with a few basic extensions like to-do lists, and notifies handling.
