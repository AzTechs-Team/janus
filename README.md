# Janus

A productivity desktop application that can make our workflow faster and easier

## What inspired us to make this project?

- A lot of productivity apps gives us a false sense of productivity and we wanted to correct that by giving a minimalist experience.

- Also we experienced in few of our previous projects, where we would have the same content in several different applications like GitHub Projects, Notion, FigJam and Discord. We were inspired to create an application that could leverage the benefits of all these applications in one place while being flexible enough to accommodate everyone's needs.
